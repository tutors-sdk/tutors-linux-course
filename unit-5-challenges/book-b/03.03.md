# How

To create the `index.html` file you should build on the knowledge that was gained in the last challenge.

The first part of the command should create the header information down to the start of the list.
```html 
<h1>Proffessor Index</h1>
<ul>
``` 

Then we should loop over the professors to and add them to the list. 
When the redirect `>>` you can append to a file, while the `>` will replace the exist file.

The elements in the list should follow the format given,
```html
<li><a href=./FILENAME>PROFESSOR NAME</a></li>
```
Or

```html
<li><a href=./EvaHill.html>Prof. Eva Hill</a></li>
``` 

After the all the professors have being added to the list you must close the list.
The list can be closed by appending `</ul>` to the end of the file.

```html
</ul>
```

The final file should look like:

```html 
<h1>Proffessor Index</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href=./EvaHill.html>Prof. Eva Hill</a></li>
<li><a href=./MichaelHill.html>Prof. Michael Hill</a></li>
</ul>
``` 

Some of the concepts that would be good to know when trying to achieve this are, loops, appending and the `&&` which allows running commands after the current has completed.
The command may take the following format, `<Header Command> && <Looping Command> && <Footer Command>`.
