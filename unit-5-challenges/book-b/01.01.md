# What 

We want to create an index page, called `index.html`, that a user can use to quickly find links to the professors. 

On the index page each link should be in a list. 
The index file should be in the format as below.
```html 
<h1>Proffessor Index</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href=./EvaHill.html>Prof. John Doe</a></li>
<li><a href=./MichaelHill.html>Prof. Jane Smith</a></li>
</ul>
```
