# How

The names file should be processed using tools like `grep`, `awk` and `echo`. 
These tools should be combined using pipes `|` and redirects `>`.

The first step should be to get a list of professors from the names files.
Their names will all be prefixed with `Prof.`.

For each of the results found create a file with the format of `<FRIST NAME><SURNAME>.html` and add the content to that file.
The one tool that maybe needed is _"while"_ loops in bash.

One thing that you should ensure is that the directory `html` exists.
