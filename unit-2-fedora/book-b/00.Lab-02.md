There are two methods of navigation through the Fedora operating system. These are via the GUI (Graphical User Interface) using the mouse, and the Terminal using bash commands.

## Objectives
By the end of this lab, students will be able to:
- Explore the Fedora file system using both GUI and terminal.
- Perform basic file operations (creating, renaming, deleting files and folders).
- Understand how to switch between applications in both the GUI and terminal.
