# Introduction to the Fedora Desktop

Downloading and Installing Applications

The Fedora Desktop works very similarly to Windows, although application icons will not appear on the Desktop screen. Instead, the activities button at the top left of the window can be used to open recent applications or search through installed apps.

In this exercise, you will install two new applications called `Extensions` and `GNOME Tweaks` which will enable settings to allow the customisation of the desktop to bring it closer to the Windows desktop experience. 

## Objectives
By the end of this lab, students will be able to:
- Search the Fedora OS for applications.
- Use the `Software` application to install other applications.
- Customise the Fedora desktop to provide functionality similar to Windows
