# Why care about text editors

As developer's we work with a lot of text in the form of as code and other types such as log files.
It is important to have a number of ways to manipulate text.

The vast majority of code files will be in plan text.
Code files will have an extensions based on the language, and these extensions allow for syntax highlighting.

Apart from code files there are also log files that as a developer, you will have to interact with.
Text editors are great for this kind of work. 

Terminal editors can also be used on server machines where there are no GUIs.
This allows editing files that are not on your machine. 

It is always good to have more tools in your tool belt and being able to edit files in both GUI and terminals will forever be useful.

Text editors are also fast to start compared to IDEs.
IDEs are very powerful, but slower to start and tend to be configured for a single project.
Many times you will need to edit files outside a project, and text editors allow this easily.
